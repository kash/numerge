					<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could see your classmates notes? What if
						you could see last years' class' notes? Numerge is a place where a
						community of note-takers can come together and share their notes.
						You can, of course, set your notes to private. But you can also
						share them with the world!</p>
					<p>Notes a categorized using tagging. For example, a note tagged as
						#school/biology/anatomy would show up any time someone searches
						for school, biology, or anatomy.</p>
