# Numerge

Numerge is a web application that keeps track of your notes. It also allows you to look at other peoples' notes (if they have it set to public). This app was developed by [Gifton](http://gifton.io) and [me](http://kash.cm).

This app was developed at Codeday in Seattle. It was a 24-hour hackathon and we had lots of fun developing it. Gifton handled the backend and I did the front-end and some backend. We developed the app using React and Node.js.

We don't have any plans to actually put this site up, but feel free to download the code and use it locally if you'd like.
